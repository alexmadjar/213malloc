max alloc size is TODO Bytes (or 0b1111111111111111111111111000 or 4 0's, 25 1's and 3 0's)
because 256kB and larger are best done using mmap

min alloc size is 4*sizeof(void*)
because free nodes contain:
node* next  // a pointer to the next node in the stack of the same size
node* left  // a pointer to the left child in the trie
node* right // a pointer to the right child in the trie
node** prev // a pointer to the node* that points here

NOTE: left and right are stored in an array in order to make access easier without using a branch statement. children[0] -> left [1] -> right

every block (whether free or allocated) has a 1 WSIZE (from here on WSIZE is defined as sizeof(size_t)) header and footer:
isAllocated = 0 or 1
size = 8 byte aligned byte-size of the block (not including the header / footer)
header/footer = size BITWISEOR isAllocated
NOTE: The total space this takes up is size + DSIZE  where DSIZE is 2*WSIZE

We create 24 bins of sizes by the number of zeros before the first 1 in the size (calculated using the clz function)
because clz(max_size) = 4 and clz(min_size) = 27
clz(size)-4 = bin number (0 through 23 inclusive)

We divide the heap space as such: (key: *=pointer, not a size; in increasing address space)
*heap base*
unused padding bytes for alignment +
* "heap" pointer *
24 WORDs for the size buckets
1 WORD set to "1"
*official heap start pointer*
1 WORD set to "1" - prologue
X BLOCKS OF FREE AND ALLOCATED MEMORY
1 WORD set to "1" - epilog
usused padding bytes - "the wilderness"
*brk pointer / end of heap*

+ NOTE: in a production malloc we would use this padding to ensure that all valid pointers are 8 byte aligned and discard all free calls with non-aligned pointers. Do we need this level of robustness?

INVARIANTS:   Things that should always be the case

* There are never two free blocks in a row (ie: no deferred coalescing)
* The structure starting with the 14 buckets, going through the trie and into the stacks contains ALL free nodes exactly once and contains no allocated nodes nor "garbage" pointers
* Free blocks are in the appropriate bin
* All sizes and pointers are 8 byte aligned
* You should be able to crawl through the entire heap forward or backward at any time using the headers / footers

In order to check the trie invariants, I have designed the following b-trie crawling test case:

foreach bin:
   foreach child (trie AND stack)
      if child doesn't share first n-bits with parent: ERROR
      // we use the allocated bit in the footer to store visits
      // and the header to keep it free
      if child is not free: ERROR
      if visitted: ERROR
      mark as visited
foreach block:
    if free & !visitted: ERROR
    mark as unvisited
